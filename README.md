# HIGHER-LOWER

Project: Higher Lower Game in Python
This project is an interactive Higher-Lower style game that tests your intuition about the popularity of different search terms based on average monthly Google searches.

Users are shown two terms and asked:
"Does Term A have more average monthly searches than Term B?"
The goal is to guess correctly and build up a high score!

🎮 Game Features
✅ Compares real-world search data across terms (e.g., “Piano” vs. “Dubai”)

⏱️ Two Game Modes:
Mode 1: No time limit

Mode 2: 10-second timer per guess
🔁 Random selection of comparison terms
📈 Tracks and displays your current and final score
❌ Ends game on incorrect guess or timeout

💡 What You’ll Learn
Working with dictionaries and random modules
Implementing game logic with conditional statements
Handling time-based input using Python’s datetime
Developing an intuitive and interactive command-line interface
